# 📊 Employee Data Analysis Project

## 📌 Overview

In this project, I analyzed employee HR data to uncover insights related to workforce distribution, salary trends, performance, attrition, and hiring patterns.

The analysis was performed using **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)** and focuses on answering key business-driven HR questions.
